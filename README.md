# Cinema backend

Project specification can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TCjkxsUsZaZGJd7NVxROLXZo3oyFp0R1/view?usp=sharing).
This project is backend for [cinema frontend](https://github.com/aleksandark99/wd_vue).
It runs on Apache-tomcat v6.0 and uses Java Servlets technology to process http requests from frontend.
Logic behind this is really simple, it is just MVC application.


It can be run directly as in webcontnet there is dist folder from vue project or frontend can be run on port(8080) and this project on(8081).
